My uni coursework which is the polyphonic subtractive VSTi synth written in C++ with WDL-OL lib.

How to build:
- clone this repo https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol
- follow the Readme file in VST_SDK of WDL-OL repo (if you need vst2 sdk create a PR, i'll send you a link)
- clone my repo and save dir with SynthWavve source to IPlugExamples folder which you can find in cloned WDL-OL repository
- open SynthWavve.sln with VS, you can do it in latest version and upgrade project's api
